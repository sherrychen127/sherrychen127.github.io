## Software Engineer Intern, Intel Corporation ##
2019 May - 2020 May


During my one-year internship (PEY) at Intel, I participated in the development of a data-driven application in Python for correlating software simulation results and silicon testing data for FPGA timing/power analysis. I re-designed the data pipeline to compile, simulate, analyze, and visualize over 1,000 design patterns daily with the goal of high parallelism and high efficiency, which reduced the total runtime by 40%. I also independently re-architected a PostgreSQL database with 1TB of data and over 100 tables for scalability, after applying various database techniques to improve the runtime efficiency, which sped up the query performance by 20%.

I interned at Thales for four months after second year. I was responsible for implementing code changes to the On-board Controller software in the Singapore digital railway signaling system. I also designed various testing scenarios to validate code changes in order to optimize the functionality of Automatic Train Protection software.
